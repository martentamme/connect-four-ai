# Connect Four
Connect Four is a two-player connection rack game in which players choose a color and take turns dropping colored tokens into a seven-column, six-row, vertically suspended grid. 
The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column.
The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own tokens.

Connect Four is a solved gameâ€” the first player can always win with the right moves.

## Description
This project aims to develop the Connect Four game logic and implement an AI opponent.
The AI will use the Monte Carlo method to make strategic decisions and compete against a human player.

## What is the Monte Carlo method?
The Monte Carlo method is a computational technique used to simulate probability-based systems and make statistical predictions using random sampling.

The Monte Carlo method involves the following steps:
1. Define the problem and the system to be simulated.
2. Define the input parameters and their probability distributions.
3. Generate a large number of random samples or simulations using these input parameters.
4. Analyze the results to estimate the probability of certain outcomes or to make predictions about the system's behavior.

The Monte Carlo method has become an essential tool in many fields, and it has led to many advances in scientific research, engineering, and business. 
Some examples of its applications include predicting the stock market, simulating complex physical systems, designing new drugs and materials, and optimizing manufacturing processes.
